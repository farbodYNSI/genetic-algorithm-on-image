The code uses a genetic algorithm to create an image that resembles a given target image.
It starts with a population of random images and evolves them over iterations.
The goal is to make the images in the population more similar to the target image.
The algorithm selects the best images, combines their features (crossover), and introduces random changes (mutation).
The process continues until a good match is found or a maximum number of attempts is reached. The results are displayed at certain points during the process.
