In this version the goal is to reconstruct a colored image using a genetic algorithm.
The code takes an input image, converts it into its three color channels (red, green, and blue), and then applies a genetic algorithm separately to each channel.
The algorithm evolves a population of binary representations for each color channel, aiming to match the target image.
