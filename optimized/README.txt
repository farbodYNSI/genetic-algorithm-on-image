In the updated version, the way the computer creates images has been improved.
Instead of using random numbers, the computer now uses a special method with only 0s and 1s.
This change makes it easier for the computer to make small, meaningful changes to the images.
The process has also been fine-tuned to work better and create more accurate results.
The goal is still to evolve images and match them to a target, but these adjustments help the computer do it more efficiently.
