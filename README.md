# genetic-algorithm-on-image
The project involves using a genetic algorithm to generate images that resemble a given target image.
In the normal version, the images are represented by random pixel values, and the genetic algorithm evolves a population of images over iterations to match the target.
The optimization introduces several changes, notably converting pixel values to binary, which increases the likelihood of making meaningful changes during mutation.
Adjustments to parameters and the representation of pixel values aim to enhance the algorithm's efficiency in evolving images to closely match the target.
Overall, the project explores ways to iteratively improve image generation through genetic operations like crossover and mutation, with a focus on finding an optimal balance for convergence and performance.
